#### Description ################################################################################################
#   This project was created utilizing the OCTOPUS package located at https://kwathen.github.io/OCTOPUS/ .
#   There are several ReadMe comments in the document to help understand the next steps.
#   When this project was created from the template if an option was not supplied then there
#   may be variables with the prefix TEMP_ which will need to be updated.

# It is a good practice to clear your environment before building your simulation/design object then
# then clean it again before you run simulations with only the minimum variables need to avoid potential
# misuse of variables
